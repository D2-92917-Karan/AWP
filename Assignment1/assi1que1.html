        <ol type="1">

            <ul type="circle">
                <li>The Title tag in HEAD</li>

                <li>Unordered lists can be created using the <b>ul</b> tag followed by <b>li</b> tags that list out the bulleted text.<b>Li</b> tag can have the attribute, <b>type = circle</b> or <b>disc</b> or <b>square</b>.</li>
                <li>Ordered lists are created using the <b>ol</b> tag followed by <b>li</b> tags that can have the attribute <b>type = 1</b> or a or <b>A</b> or <b>I</b></li>
            </ul>

    <p> In addition to lists, the text can be “physically formatted” to appear
        either bold or italicized or underlined or strike through or it could also be subscripted or superscripted
        depending
        upon the need of the creator.</p>

    <p>The text can be made to appear more attractive using font of various styles. The <font>font</font> tag does this
        job. The <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">face</font> attribute can change the font style to whichever
        it is equated to. The <font size="2">size</font> attribute will change the font size which can range from 1 to
        7. <font color="red"><b>color</b> attribute will obviously change font color if equated to various combinations
            of RGB values</font>
    </p>

    <p> This apart if the background color has of the document has to be varied then, the <b>bgColor</b> attribute of
        the <b>body</b> tag can be set or the entire text can be aligned using the <b>align</b> attribute. Indentation
        with the help of the “paragraph tags” or a new line character with a line break can be achieved. Some special
        characters like copyright i.e.  or registered trademark i.e.  that are not the part of a standard keyboard can
        be inserted using the HTML character set. Apart from it, if the < &> signs are to displayed on the browser then
            corresponding character set equivalent has to be chosen. Text alignment can be either left / center / right;
            this can be done using the <b>div</b> container tag that has the <b>align</b> attribute. You can set the
            alignment accordingly. </p>

    <p>The power of net lies in its capacity to link various web pages scattered over different places on the net. The
        web pages can be anchored to each other using the a href tags. For instance <A
            HREF=http://www.anuda.com/index.html>Click here </A> will link to the website referenced by HREF. The user
        interface becomes better looking if images are included using the img tag. Its attributes <b>src, height, width,
            align, border</b> etc will produce corresponding effects. Images can be made clickable if the <b>img</b> tag
        is contained within the anchor tags as demonstrated. </p>

    <p><b>An image is to be inserted exactly at the bottom at the center position, should be square in shape with a
            border & should display a text when the mouse moves over it. Another clickable image that will lead to a
            different HTML page should also be inserted at the topmost portion of the web page, it should be wide enough
            to fit almost 75% of the page’s center. </b></p>
